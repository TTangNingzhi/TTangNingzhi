## 👋 Hi, I'm Ningzhi (唐宁直)

I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame, advised by [Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) in the SaNDwichLab 🥪. My research sits at the intersection of AI, Software Engineering, and HCI. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at SUSTech in Shenzhen.

- 🛠️ I'm a **full-stack software engineer** and **AI researcher**. I build interactive tools and conduct user studies to explore how developers understand, modify, and collaborate with AI-generated code.
- 💼 I'm actively looking for **research internships or product team roles for Summer 2026**, especially in **AI-powered developer tools** and human-centered AI.
- 🚀 Outside of research, I'm learning actively about finance and entrepreneurship, particularly how to **amplify human capabilities with AI** in the AGI era. Always happy to chat about wild startup ideas. 💡
- 🌱 I'm also curious about philosophy and theology as forms of spiritual cultivation in modern life—especially how their ideas can be embodied in practice, such as in reflections on *["what makes a meaningful life?"](https://godandgoodlife.nd.edu/topics/)*.
- 🎈 Fun fact: I'm obsessed with furry companions like 🐱 British Shorthairs / Ragdolls and 🐶 Mini Aussies / Bernese Mountain Dogs.

📬 Always happy to connect with engineers, researchers, and builders — reach me via
